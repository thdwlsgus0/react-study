This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### 리액트를 왜 사용하지?

- 사용자 경험
- 재사용 컴포넌트
- 데이터-화면 일치

### React.Component

- 컴포넌트를 class 또는 함수로 정의
- class로 정의된 컴포넌트는 많은 기능을 제공합니다.
- React 컴포넌트 class를 정의하려면 React.Component를 상속받아야 합니다.
- 컴포넌트 생명주기
- props 또는 state가 변경되면 갱신이 발생합니다.

### 첫번째 리액트 컴포넌트

- hello.js

리액트 컴포넌트를 만들 땐 다음의 키워드를 반드시 넣어주어야 합니다.

    import React from 'react';

- app.js에서 기존에 만들어주었던 컴포넌트 hello를 불러옵니다.

### 리액트 기본문법

1. JSX = 리액트에서 생김새를 정의할 때, 사용하는 문법
   - 꼭 닫혀야하는 태그
   - 꼭 감싸져야하는 태그
   - JSX 안에 자바스크립트 값 사용하기
   - style과 className 사용하기
